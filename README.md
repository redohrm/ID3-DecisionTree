# ID3-DecisionTree
Implements the ID3 algorithm to classify objects with continuous attribute values.

This project utilizes the ID3 algorithm to build a decision tree. Tests were run to determine the accuracy of the classification 
under a variety of circumstances. The program is tested on two separate datasets, one on iris classification and one on cancer 
classification. Please refer to report.pdf for more details and analysis results.
